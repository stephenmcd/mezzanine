Version 4.0.0 (Jul 09, 2015)
----------------------------

  * Strip punctuation from keywords instead of non-alphanumeric chars, since languages like Hindi use characters that Python doesn't consider to be alphanumeric - Stephen McDonald
  * Unpin tzlocal version 1.0 - Alex Hill
  * Update tinymce setup to use browsers' built in spell checking. Tested and works in latest FireFox and Chrome and Safari - joshcartme
  * Support custom user models in admin password change view. Previously it was assumed that the user's pw change view is at "auth/user/(\d+)/password/", which caused NoReverseMatch with custom models - Rivo Laks
  * Fix admin password change for Django 1.5 - Stephen McDonald
  * Support Django 1.7 migrations - Baylee Feore
  * Don't remove south when ``USE_SOUTH`` isn't defined - Stephen McDonald
  * Use ``is_staff`` to check for logged in user in base admin template. Closes #1114 - Stephen McDonald
  * beautifulsoup version should not be pinned exactly. There's no need to require exactly 4.1.3 - Gavin Wahl
  * Added brackets for Python 3 print() - Tuk Bredsdorff
  * Handle malformed user agent strings. Closes #1116 - Stephen McDonald
  * Configure ``SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES`` setting to check for custom south migration packages - Stephen McDonald
  * Move ``south_migrations`` -> migrations/south - Stephen McDonald
  * Added `The Entrepreneurial School <http://theentrepreneurialschool.com/>` to site using Mezzanine - Renyi Khor
  * Fix DoesNotExist when non admin visits /admin. SitePermission objects are only added when staff users are created. If a non admin user (with no manually assigned site permissions) visits the admin a DoesNotExist is raised since no site permissions exist for the user. Therefore the templatetags logic should only run if the user is staff - joshcartme
  * Exposed ``JQUERY_UI_FILENAME`` for templates - wrwrwr
  * wordpress export is under Tools, not Settings - Gavin Wahl
  * Renamed all ``get_query_set`` methods to ``get_queryset``. Django 1.6 normalized the naming, providing a metaclass that handles. previous naming schemes, while printing a warning. See: ``https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15363``. This is probably incompatible with 1.5, but limits the amount of. Django 1.8 deprecation warnings - wrwrwr
  * Explicitly list fields when defining form from model. This only changes one test (`` test_richtext_widget``), but here's a. short article that may explain why ``fields`` or ``exclude`` becomes. mandatory argument to ``modelform_factory`` and why you actually may. want to explicitly list fields to be available in forms: ``http://blog.mhartl.com/2008/09/21/mass-assignment-in-rails-applications/`` - wrwrwr
  * Unfrozen future, pep and flakes. If the reason to keep these at some fixed old versions still exists,. please add a comment - wrwrwr
  * Let sqlite configuration not contain a ``NAME`` at all (as with some settings environments) - wrwrwr
  * Resolve race condition in ``conf.settings`` - Alex Hill
  * Fixed a couple of block comments not starting with hash and space - wrwrwr
  * List form fields (as recommended) to preserve compatibility with 1.5. The ``"__all__"`` shortcut must be ``past-1.6`` only - wrwrwr
  * Fixed ``test_login_required`` when run without ``mezzanine.accounts``. Note 1: Always testing both scenerios no matter what's in the settings. would be thorough, but without something like the 1.7+ ``modify_settings``. it turns out ugly. It would be better to run the whole suite with and. without some optional apps. Note 2: This test passes when run through ``runtests``, but it cheats. by forcing ``mezzanine.accounts`` into installed apps ;-) - wrwrwr
  * Allow Mezzanine's static files handling to support ``MEDIA_ROOT`` outside of ``STATIC_ROOT`` during development - Stephen McDonald
  * Don't colorize the terminal banner if color sequences aren't supported - Stephen McDonald
  * Cleaned up ``in_menus`` defaults test. Making use of the runtime settings changes support - wrwrwr
  * Added failing settings race condition test - Alex Hill
  * Simpler fix for race condition in settings - Alex Hill
  * Reorder and add comments to settings test - Alex Hill
  * Overwrite settings cache when loading from DB - Alex Hill
  * Clear DB settings after test run - Alex Hill
  * Made forms tests use Mezzanine's TestCase. Not currently necessary, but potentially surprising if you add something. to the TestCase - wrwrwr
  * Added a simple decorator defining ``get_query_set`` or ``get_queryset``. allowing to use the latter one while preserving compatibility with 1.5. Django (1.6+) uses a metaclass to allow usage of the former name after. renaming a method (``django.utils.deprecation.RenameMethodsBase``), but. for the 2 cases in Mezzanine a decorator seems sufficient and less. intrusive - wrwrwr
  * Replaced usage of ``Options.get_(add|change|delete)_permission`` with. ``auth.get_permission_codename``. Just a single case in ``utils/views.py``. The former one is deprecated and will be removed in Django 1.8; see. ``https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/20642`` - wrwrwr
  * Added an 1.5-compatible implementation of ``get_permission_codename`` - wrwrwr
  * Made MenusField respect the current value of ``PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES_DEFAULT`` - wrwrwr
  * Small semantic change in MenusField behavior, now ``in_menus`` returns an. empty tuple instead of None for a page not in any menu. This seems more consistent with ``PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES_DEFAULT`` = tuple() - wrwrwr
  * Made MenusField also support dynamic changes to ``PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES``. This costs a call to a private ``Field._get_choices()``, because. ``Field.choices`` is already a property - wrwrwr
  * Extended the ``test_login_required`` to check if ``LOGIN_URL`` set to view or. pattern name still allows the decorator to work as expected. The new cases are only checked if ``mezzanine.accounts`` is installed. These additional ``LOGIN_URL`` possibilities were introduced in 1.5; view. objects should also work, but don't seem to be documented - wrwrwr
  * Don't test the new options with 1.4, it's not supposed to support them - wrwrwr
  * Prevent duplicate app names when testing - Stephen McDonald
  * Extend ``renamed_get_queryset`` to also support admin classes, and apply to OwnableAdmin - Stephen McDonald
  * ``set_slug`` now save itself - Dustin Broderick
  * ``set_slug`` now saves itself - Dustin Broderick

  * Actually skip the threading test as expected - Stephen McDonald
  * Fix version check in ``post_syncdb`` signals - Stephen McDonald
  * Added description of "label" keyword argument of ``register_settings``. function to docs - eyeinthebrick
  * Cache site ID on request object, even when fallback setting is used. Closes #1144 - Stephen McDonald
  * Fix site ID fallback when testing - Stephen McDonald
  * separate basic gallery functionality. to be more flexible with creating galleries we can separate gallery. functionality so it can be reused if developer wants to create a. gallery but not necessarily a gallery page - Robert Zywucki
  * Added a test for DynamicInlineAdmin - wrwrwr
  * Allow DynamicInlineAdmin fields to be a tuple. Previously, if fields was defined as a tuple, a very confusing TypeError. would be raised - Rocky Meza
  * Travis test the latest versions of Django. This way you don't have to update every time a security release comes. out - Rocky Meza
  * Re-instate conf test as per recent threading fixes. Closes #858 - Stephen McDonald
  * Return HTTP 405 on comment/rating URLs for GET requests. Closes #1159 - Stephen McDonald
  * Fix Travis Django installation - Rocky Meza
  * Shamelessly modified the dynamic admin fields tuple test, so it checks. ``get_fieldsets()`` instead of directly using the fields attribute. Also made BaseDynamicInlineAdmin work when fields are listed without. the ``_order`` field or fieldsets are declared (with or without it) - wrwrwr
  * SiteRelated changed to allow explicit site assignment on creation - Kelvin Wong
  * Made "flake8 ." output less warnings. Excluded ``docs/conf.py`` as its autogenerated by Sphinx and increased. acceptable complexity from 10 to 20 - wrwrwr
  * Allowed optional apps to be loaded for testing - wrwrwr
  * Separated generation of ``short_urls`` from their saving - wrwrwr
  * include menu pages in broader context. issue #1154 - Eduardo S. Klein

  * Factored out deleting unused keywords as a manager method - wrwrwr
  * Removed ``django_extensions`` from ``INSTALLED_APPS`` for testing - wrwrwr
  * Fixed ``pages.test_login_required`` with I18N / LocaleMiddleware - wrwrwr
  * Fixed ``core.test_password_reset`` with ``i18n_patterns`` - wrwrwr
  * Use the response context during two-phase rendering. If a response has `context_data` use that instead of creating a new. context and running context processors again - David Sanders
  * Fix for using response ``context_data`` - David Sanders
  * Remove call to ``set_model_permissions`` in page admin - Alex Hill
  * Backout context processor changes to cache middleware for now, re #1174 - Stephen McDonald
  * Prevent order setting vs. form submission race condition. If the js runs slow for any reason the admin form can submit before the order of inlines has been set - joshcartme
  * Create new model field OrderField - Alex Hill
  * ``OrderWidget.is_hidden`` should evaluate False - Alex Hill
  * Update orderable ordering to use the submit event. It seems that the click event may not be guaranteed to run in FireFox before the form actually submits. This may be due to a variety of factors including the version of jQuery but for now switching to the submit event solves the problem - joshcartme
  * Fixed spelling of 'collapsed' - Stone C. Lasley
  * Refactored all the initial data setup to only occur when the createdb command is used, since Django 1.7's migrations no longer provide a signal that can reliably trap when tables are created - Stephen McDonald
  * Added migrations for changed ``_order`` field - Stephen McDonald
  * Host the dashboard screentshot in the docs so it can be correctly referenced on github - Stephen McDonald

  * Refactored the ``fields_for`` templatetag to allow for custom field template - Avery Laird
  * nginx conf: use Mozilla recommended ciphers. For the included ``nginx.conf``, use the ciphersuite recommended by the Operations. Security team at the Mozilla project: ``https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS``. The ones included here are the ones labelled "Intermediate compatibility". They. also document a ciphersuite with a higher level of security on that page. labelled "Modern compatibility", though it excludes more older browsers - Lorin Hochstein

  * Don't assume ``INSTALLED_APPS`` is all modules as Django 1.7 adds AppConfig - Frankie Robertson

  * Test up to Python 3.4 and Django up to 1.8 - Alex Hill
  * Test with Py 3.4, Django 1.7 and default runners. Update ``.travis.yml`` config to run tests under Python 3.4 and Django 1.7. Future-proof the test script to work with both default test runners: DjangoTestSuiteRunner ``pre-1.6``, and DiscoverRunner in 1.6 and later. Under DiscoverRunner, the ``django.contrib`` tests won’t be run - Alex Hill
  * Enable SHA1 hasher for happy Django 1.4 tests - Alex Hill
  * Miscellaneous backwards-compatible 1.8 fixes. Includes changes to Meta, some moved functions and various internal API. changes - Alex Hill
  * Accommodate Django 1.8's template system changes. Django 1.8 introduces the possibility of using multiple template. engines, which means that some components of Django's template system. have been encapsulated in an Engine class instead of being available. globally, and other parts refactored and moved around - Alex Hill
  * Remove Django 1.4 and 1.5 from ``.travis.yml`` - Alex Hill
  * No need to enable SHA1 hasher in tests > 1.4 - Alex Hill
  * Remove ``mezzanine.utils.models.get_user_model``. This was introduced for compatibility with Django 1.4 after Django 1.5. included support for custom User models. Now that we no longer support. Django 1.4, we can just use the builtin version. Still need to remove references in filebrowser, so the import remains. in ``mezzanine.utils.models`` - Alex Hill
  * Remove shims for ``force_text`` and ``smart_text``. Not necessary since dropping support for Django 1.4 - Alex Hill
  * Deleted ``mezzanine/utils/deprecation.py``. This contained compatibility fixes for Django < 1.6, which we no longer. support - Alex Hill

  * Render form errors with a new {% ``errors_for`` %} template tag. This new template tag accomplishes three things: - Fixes the bug of multiple form error messages appearing when using. {% ``fields_for`` %}. This bug was intruduced in [this ``commit](https://github.com/jerivas/mezzanine/commit/323660db5bee7e21358315c4e247eaa8ee77b034)``. and was discovered when [migrating Cartridge to ``BS3](https://github.com/clemensbasti/cartridge/pull/1)``. - Decouples error message rendering from form field rendering, with. the added flexibility of placing the error messages wherever we want. - Creates a new template ``(includes/form_errors.html)`` as the single. location to control form error rendering through all Mezzanine and. Cartridge - Eduardo Rivas

  * Delete BS2 static resources. Add BS3 resources: css, js and fonts - Eduardo Rivas
  * Migrated ``base.html`` and all it's includes to BS3 - Eduardo Rivas
  * Strip ``STATIC_URL``, leading / from proxied URLs. ``STATIC_URL`` often contains host or ``generic_host`` (esp. if ``STATIC_URL`` is a. path on the same domain), so it needs to be removed first to ensure it. is removed completely. Also removed leading '/' from URL, since it. appears staticfiles doesn't like absolute paths - Adam Brenecki

Version 1.4.13 (Sep 10, 2013)
-----------------------------

  * Allow for there being no "errors" in the twitter api response. When a successful "user" query to the twitter api is completed the json that is returned is a list. In order to validate the response the code tests to see if it was a dictionary with an "error" key. However passing a string as a index to a list will raise a TypeError, which was not being caught by the "except" clause. I have added TypeError to the list of items being caught. There are of course other ways of verifying the response but I think just adding the TypeError is in keeping with what you have already done. For reference, here is what I was seeing: > python ``manage.py`` ``poll_twitter`` --traceback --force. Traceback (most recent call last): ,. File ``"/,/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mezzanine/twitter/models.py"``, line 74, in run. raise TwitterQueryException(tweets["errors"][0]["message"]).

  * Handling case when diff between min and max count is smaller than size. Weights were not calculated correctly when difference between `max_count` and `min_count` was smaller than `settings.TAG_CLOUD_SIZES`. Changed calculation of weights to use floating point arithmetic.

An alias for the ``richtext_filter`` template filter has been added to. match the plural nature of the new setting: ``richtext_filters`` simply. calls on ``richtext_filter`` for its output - Tim Valenta

  * Editable settings refactor - this change is to clear up confusion around editable settings being defined in a project's settings module. Previously when this happened, the ``settings.py`` module value would only serve as a default, which would be superceded by the db editable value as soon as the settings admin form is first saved. To address this, this change means that editable settings defined in the project's ``settings.py`` module now mark the setting as not editable, so it will always be the value used. We also include some handling for the migration case so that even with this change, editable settings already in the db that have a ``settings.py`` value defined will still use the db value and provide a warning - Stephen McDonald
  * Revert the handling for still using db values for editable settings with ``settings.py`` values defined, since it basically defeats the purpose if a ``settings.py`` value is added once a project is live - Stephen McDonald

  * Use CSS instead of JavaScript for the admin app dropdowns. There were some bugs with the dropdowns when they were in JavaScript: 1. When you open a dropdown and then scroll, the dropdown would stay. put, instead of following the scroll. 2. The JavaScript used `.live('mouseover')` which binds to body and. wastes memory because it's fired for mouseover on every single DOM. element. 3. Occasionally, the dropdowns never disappeared even after mouseout. This commit fixes those bugs by using CSS and `:hover` instead of. JavaScript.

It is a pixel for pixel match of the previous functionality and. appearance - Rocky Meza

  * Update the default twitter query since it's been flooded by movie tweets - Stephen McDonald
  * Add a deprecation layer for settings in templates, and deprecate the ``PAGES_MENU_SHOW_ALL`` setting since it's too specific for a setting and can be implemented in one line in a template - Stephen McDonald
  * Added an example to the page menu docs of rendering a tree representing the current section of a site being viewed - Stephen McDonald
  * Don't need to uncheck ``in_menus`` for an editable homepage anymore, so remove the comment describing that - Stephen McDonald
  * Correctly handle file uploads in profile forms - Stephen McDonald

  * Also check ``BLOG_USE_FEATURED_IMAGE`` in templates when displaying blog post's featured image - Stephen McDonald

  * Restore permission check for editable JS/CSS - Stephen McDonald
  * Added handling for model field defaults in dynamic inlines. Closes #526 - Stephen McDonald
  * Precedence of conflicting page processor context. The order of execution of page processors was reversed in #315 so that custom page processors returning an HttpResponse would bypass the default processors. That had the side-effect of making context variables in default processors overwrite those in custom processors, which isn't very intuitive. This change restores the original behaviour of context variables, while retaining the reversed execution order - Alex Hill

  * Hopefully fix MRO regression - David Novakovic
  * Fix MRO issues and avoid regression at the same time - David Novakovic
  * Protect sequences provided or generated for the default value of ``MenusField`` from being forced to unicode (as for example u'[1, 2, 3]'). Django forces fields defaults to unicode unless they're callable (see ``Field.get_default``). This is done to prevent problems that could arise from setting the same mutable object as a default for many fields (see Django ticket #18478) - wrwrwr
  * add fa and ``fa_IR`` locales - Mahdi Bornazadeh
  * Clean up use of ``AUTH_USER_MODEL`` - Stephen McDonald

  * Allow pages to be dragged out of a subtree to the root level in page admin - wrwrwr
  * Check that setting a new page parent won't cause a cycle in the parent-child graph. Such cycles lead to an infinite loop in ``Page.save`` ``(e.g``. python process consuming all resources) - wrwrwr
  * Altered git ``repo_url`` checks to allow ssh hosted git repositories - Travis Nickles
  * Fixed indentation issue and PEP-8 issue with fabfile mods - Travis Nickles
  * Don't try to create any pages if the models it uses aren't installed - Gavin Wahl

  * Fix some missing imports and settings import errors for the new user model hooks - Stephen McDonald
  * Added possibility to set custom menu titles for models in ``ADMIN_MENU_ORDER``, using the same notation as for views ``(e.g``. ``(_("News")``, ``"blog.BlogPost"))`` - wrwrwr
  * Avoid fixing parent slug in ``Page.set_parent`` if the page had no slug to start with - wrwrwr
  * Use ``current_page`` instead of request for ``is_current``. Since we already have the 'current page' object, we can compare it. against ourself to find if we are current - Gavin Wahl
  * Replace the rating form with a message after user casts a vote - wrwrwr
  * Use ``content_model`` not the base Page in PageAdmin. When calling methods on a page, they should be called on the subclass,. not the base Page. This allows page types to override them - Gavin Wahl
  * The usage of reversion can now be disabled for DisplayableAdmin - uli
  * Update admin menu docs to mention labels for regaulr models - Stephen McDonald
  * Change new reversion setting to be opt-in instead of opt-out - Stephen McDonald

  * Bring templates in line with latest master - Alex Hill
  * Move forward compatibility code to ``utils/conf.py`` - Alex Hill
  * Assume development server if command is "harvest". Lettuce uses the "harvest" command to run a development server. See ``http://lettuce.it/recipes/django-lxml.html#lettuce-run-the-tests``. Note that if this isn't set, then media will not be served correctly. when testing with lettuce - Lorin Hochstein
  * Bump versions: ``filebrowser_safe`` >= 0.2.12, ``grappelli_safe`` >= 0.2.10 - Stephen McDonald
  * Use non-minified ``jquery.tools`` and ``jquery.ba-resize`` - Per Andersson

  * Use createdb --nodata in fabfile - Stephen McDonald
  * Use actual keyword instances in blog listing. Closes #431 - Stephen McDonald
  * Put block tags into all blog templates so they can be overridden. Closes #443. This resulted in the splitting of the editable field for the title and. publication date in the list page into two editable fields, so they. could be two separate blocks. I notice that the blog detail page. doesn't have an editable field for the publish date at all, which I. shall address separately. block tags are namespaced by ``blog_post_detail_`` and ``blog_post_list_``. respectively, and inside the list page, the blocks related to an. individual post are namespaced with ``blog_post_list_post_`` - Penny Leach
  * Made publication date an editable field in the blog post detail template - Penny Leach
  * Remove selection disabling in ``page_tree.js`` - causing issues with latest Firefox - Stephen McDonald
  * Added some missing calls to ``richtext_filter``. Closes #438 - Stephen McDonald
  * Correctly handle empty password in login form. Closes #439 - Stephen McDonald

  * Add some extra comments and validation for the new ``FORMS_EXTRA_FIELDS`` setting - Stephen McDonald
  * Allow LoginForm to be inherited and extended - Renyi Khor
  * Slugged model now uses ``self.title`` to generate slug. Fixes #445 - Andrey Shipilov
  * Update ``mezzanine/blog/models.py``. wrong keyword argument passed to ``blog_post_list_category`` in ``get_absolute_url`` for the BlogCategory model. This results in an empty url when using <a hreg="{{ ``category.get_absolute_url`` }}">Link to my Category</a>. The problem was that the ``blog/urls.py`` uses 'category' as the keyword and the ``get_absolute_url`` used 'slug' as the keyword. I changed it within ``get_absolute_url`` because I guess changing it within ``blog/urls.py`` may break backwards compatibility - Andre Graf
  * Port gallery expose to updated jquerytools version. On overlay load, expose the ``.image-overlay``. Fixes bug where every other image was not exposed due to timing issue. when #exposeMask fades out when already switched to next image - Per Andersson
  * Use local copies of instead of cdn. * html5shiv. * jquery mobile - Per Andersson
  * Move ``html5shiv.js`` outside of Mezzanine's js directory, since it's not required by Mezzanine itself (eg it's project specific and can be removed per project) - Stephen McDonald
  * Update ``blog_recent_posts`` to allow an optional slug. If the slug is specified returned blog posts will be restricted to being in the category matching the slug. If the slug does not match a category, posts will be returned as normal - joshcartme
  * Added support for keyword args in the ``as_tag`` template tag wrapper - Stephen McDonald
  * Fix for issue #450: ``home_slug`` with prefix - uli

  * Only check if a user has access to the current site in the middleware. Save the result on ``request.user`` and use this elsewhere - Josh Cartmell
  * Added the setting ``OWNABLE_MODELS_ALL_EDITABLE`` which allows a sequence of ``app_label.model_name`` models to be defined, that are Ownable subclasses which won't have their change-list admin views filtered by user - Stephen McDonald
  * Updated signal to only automatically create admin profiles for staff and not break the User add view if a site is selected - Josh Cartmell

  * Don't run view functions from page middleware when no page can be found, just pass through. Closes #476 - Stephen McDonald
  * Update jquery-ui to full 1.9.1, and include smoothness theme. This allows other apps to use a single version of jquery-ui that is. known to be compatible with Mezzanine's version of jquery. This is ``jquery-ui-1.9.1.all``, so all widgets are available and no. additional jquery code is needed. Also, the full smoothness theme. is included. Third-party apps may include other themes - Ahmad Khayyat

  * Added {% ``search_form`` %} section to the docs - Eduardo Rivas
  * Update ``mezzanine/pages/admin.py``. Remove a blank line so tests will pass - Kenneth Love

  * Adds the ability to move a page under a page with no children.

  * Allow non-page views to specify their own ``editable_obj`` context variable, which is then used to determine the url for the admin link in the editable toolbar, falling back to the current page object. Allows for things like blog posts and Cartridge products to contain a direct admin link from the ditable toolbar - Stephen McDonald
  * Remove unused ``grappelli_safe`` urlpatterns - Stephen McDonald
  * Bump ``grappelli_safe`` version to 0.2.9 - Stephen McDonald

  * Use dynamically generated intro for posts in blog listing page rather than the description field - stephenmcd

Version 0.8.3 (Sep 29, 2010)
----------------------------

  * Workaround for when mezzanine is hosted under a different urlspace. (Only tested with Django admin, not grappelli). The ``keywords.js`` file needs to reference a mezzanine URL, from the admin site. It used to use a hard-coded string with a root-absolute path, but this failed when mezzanine was hosted elsewhere. Instead, we now reference a global Mezzanine JS object, which is set by template, using URL reversal to find the correct url. This requires a reworking in how the PageAdmin object accesses its Media settings - previously the list of js files was calculated at module load time, but at this stage the url reversal mechanism won't work, because the ``urls.py`` aren't all loaded yet, Instead, we hide the list generation inside a lazy iterator object and create the list on demand - Toby White
  * Fix admin menu for earlier than Python 2.6 which lacks ``tuple.index`` - stephenmcd
  * add active class to footer menu - lexual
  * Don't fail if ``PACKAGE_NAME_FILEBROWSER`` or ``PACKAGE_NAME_GRAPELLI`` aren't set - just don't try & load them - Toby White
  * Fix grappelli/filebrowser package creation scripts to be Python 2.5 compatible. Closes #12 - stephenmcd
  * Create a template tag for reversing urls from within admin templates that fail silently when the url can't be reversed, as this is always the case when running admin tests. Apply this to both the admin dropdown menu and to the base admin template making all templates aware of the ``admin_keyword_submit`` URL so that it does not need to be hard-coded - stephenmcd
  * Backed out changeset: d43f3e430d1f - stephenmcd
  * Replace MobileTemplate middleware with a decorator. If mezzanine is being used as an application within another project, then the MobileTemplate middleware may not be appropriate to use on URLs outside of mezzanine's control. In fact, if the project uses other calling conventions (eg class-based views) then the middleware may fail completely - Toby White
  * Fix positioning of admin dropdown menu in Firefox. Closes #11 - stephenmcd

  * Give the Page object a ``get_admin_url`` property, which we can use to provide direct links to a Page's admin page from the editable toolbar - Toby White

  * Allow search fields for ``SearchableManager`` to be defined across multiple models in an inheritance chain - stephenmcd
  * Refactor models to remove the ``content`` field from the ``pages.Page`` model (and therefore the ``core.Displayable`` model from which it inherits) so that custom content types can be created without the ``content`` field. Introduces a new default content type ``pages.ContentPage`` - stephenmcd
