Looking the import module path up in ``sys.modules`` gives. the full path. With this change it is possible to do use ``example_com.mybest`` as a host theme for. ``mybest.example.com`` (with main site ``example_com)``. Otherwise ``host_theme_path()``. would return ``'example_com'`` when trying to import ``'example_com.mybest'`` - Enrico Tröger

  * Add perms to existing context page instead of overwriting it. Previously the template tag ``set_page_permissions`` would retrieve the. page's content model, set the perms attribute on it, and then replace. the page object in the context with the retrieved object.

  * Always use the name from the comment form, rather than the user's username, since by default it's their email address - Stephen McDonald
  * Use ``comments.select_related(user)`` when loading comments, since Django's Comment model will query for the user each time a comment is loaded - Stephen McDonald

  * Added the decorator ``mezzanine.pages.decorators.for_page``, which can be used for wrapping views that map to protected pages. The decorator adds the page instance to the template context, and handles login redirects if ``page.login_required`` is True.

  * Fixed admin page tree on reload. The problem occured when reloading a page after setting an open child branch's. parent as closed. When you reloaded a page the routine that would. reopen previously opened child branches (that are currently hidden by a parent). was causing said child branch displaying both the show(+) and hide(-). icons side by side which could be seen when reopening the parent. It would also cause this said hidden, opened child branch. to no longer be registered in the opened branch cookie. So if you were to. reload the page again, this branch wouldn't be opened at all. The solution involves simply reopening all previously opened branches on. reload without worrying about adding their ID's again to the cookie. It also. avoids using the Jquery toggle() function which seemed to be the problem. that caused both the show(+) and hide(-) buttons to appear - Kowaleski, Jason

  * Use dynamically generated intro for posts in blog listing page rather than the description field - stephenmcd

Version 0.8.3 (Sep 30, 2010)
----------------------------

  * Workaround for when mezzanine is hosted under a different urlspace. (Only tested with Django admin, not grappelli). The ``keywords.js`` file needs to reference a mezzanine URL, from the admin site. It used to use a hard-coded string with a root-absolute path, but this failed when mezzanine was hosted elsewhere. Instead, we now reference a global Mezzanine JS object, which is set by template, using URL reversal to find the correct url. This requires a reworking in how the PageAdmin object accesses its Media settings - previously the list of js files was calculated at module load time, but at this stage the url reversal mechanism won't work, because the ``urls.py`` aren't all loaded yet, Instead, we hide the list generation inside a lazy iterator object and create the list on demand - Toby White
  * Fix admin menu for earlier than Python 2.6 which lacks ``tuple.index`` - stephenmcd
  * add active class to footer menu - lexual
  * Don't fail if ``PACKAGE_NAME_FILEBROWSER`` or ``PACKAGE_NAME_GRAPELLI`` aren't set - just don't try & load them - Toby White
  * Fix grappelli/filebrowser package creation scripts to be Python 2.5 compatible. Closes #12 - stephenmcd
  * Create a template tag for reversing urls from within admin templates that fail silently when the url can't be reversed, as this is always the case when running admin tests. Apply this to both the admin dropdown menu and to the base admin template making all templates aware of the ``admin_keyword_submit`` URL so that it does not need to be hard-coded - stephenmcd
  * Backed out changeset: d43f3e430d1f - stephenmcd
  * Replace MobileTemplate middleware with a decorator. If mezzanine is being used as an application within another project, then the MobileTemplate middleware may not be appropriate to use on URLs outside of mezzanine's control. In fact, if the project uses other calling conventions (eg class-based views) then the middleware may fail completely - Toby White
  * Fix positioning of admin dropdown menu in Firefox. Closes #11 - stephenmcd
  * Remove stray pdb - Toby White
  * Let the location of the tinymce scripts be overridden - Toby White

  * Add a filtering form for exporting responses in the forms app - stephenmcd
