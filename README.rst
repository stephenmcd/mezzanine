Overview
========

Mezzanine is a powerful, consistent, and flexible content management
platform. Built using the `Django`_ framework, Mezzanine provides a
simple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages diving in
and hacking on the code. Mezzanine is `BSD licensed`_ and supported by
a diverse and active community.

In some ways, Mezzanine resembles tools such as `Wordpress`_,
providing an intuitive interface for managing pages, blog posts, form
data, store products, and other types of content. But Mezzanine is
also different. Unlike many other platforms that make extensive use of
modules or reusable applications, Mezzanine provides most of its
functionality by default. This approach yields a more integrated and
efficient platform.

Visit the `Mezzanine project page`_ to see some of the `great sites
people have built using Mezzanine`_.

Support
=======

To **report a security issue**, please send an email privately to

For **all other Mezzanine support**, the primary channel is the

requests, and all other related discussions should take place here.

If you're **certain** you've come across a bug, then please use the
`GitHub issue tracker`_, however it's crucial that enough information
is provided to reproduce the bug, ideally with a small code sample repo
we can simply fork, run, and see the issue with. Other useful
information includes things such as the Python stack trace generated by
error pages, as well as other aspects of the development environment
used, such as operating system, database, and Python version. If
