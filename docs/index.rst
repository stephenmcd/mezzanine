Mezzanine
=========

Welcome to the Mezzanine project. To learn more about Mezzanine please
read the :doc:`overview` which contains a feature list, installation
guide and other general information.

*Back-end developers* can get a better technical overview of how
content is managed and how to customize Mezzanine in general by
reading about Mezzanine's :doc:`content-architecture` which describes
the main components and how to extend them with your own custom
content types, or by reading about :doc:`model-customization` for
implementing more low-level customizations as required. There is also
a section on the :doc:`admin-customization` provided by Mezzanine.

*Front-end developers* can read about how :doc:`themes` are used to
skin a Mezzanine project as well as how to set up templates for
specific :doc:`device-handling` such as phones. Mezzanine also comes
with the ability for content authors to edit content directly within a
page while viewing it on the website. You can read about this and how
to implement this feature within templates under :doc:`inline-editing`.

*Further reading* includes information about Mezzanine's
:doc:`search-engine`, a section on Mezzanine's :doc:`configuration`
which outlines the various settings for configuring Mezzanine, and
some notes on :doc:`deployment`. Lastly, you can learn about
:doc:`blog-importing` into Mezzanine, or just browse the
auto-generated docs for each of Mezzanine's :doc:`packages`.
