"Mezzanine comes with the ability to use different sets of templates "
"depending on the device being used to access the website. For example one "
"set of templates may be used for desktop browsers with a corresponding set "
"of templates being used for mobile phones."

"Devices are grouped into types with each type being named after the sub-"
"directory containing its specific set of templates. Each device is then "
"defined by a list of strings that could be found in the user agent that "
"matches the particular device. This mapping of device sub-directory names to"
" user agent strings is defined in the setting ``DEVICE_USER_AGENTS``::"

"Given the above example value for ``DEVICE_USER_AGENTS``, suppose a view or "
"template referenced the template ``blog/index.html``. If an iPhone made the "
"request to the website, the template ``mobile/blog/index.html`` would be "
"searched for, and if a Windows OS made the request then the template "
"``desktop/blog/index.html`` would be searched for."

"If the device specific templates don't exist or a user agent isn't matched "
"to any of the device specific strings, then the original template name "
"(``blog/index.html`` in the above example) will be used as per usual with "
"Django. This means that supporting device specific templates is entirely "
"optional."

"You can also specify which device should be treated as the default by "

" the ``mobile`` device group are used even when no matching user agent is "
"found, simply define the following in your project's ``settings`` module::"

"Using the ``DEVICE_USER_AGENTS`` setting, Mezzanine simply prefixes any "
"referenced template path with the device specific sub-directory name if a "
"user agent matches one of the strings specified for the device. For example "
"if a user agent matches the ``mobile`` device set of templates, a reference "
"to ``blog/index.html`` will be changed to the list "
"``[\"mobile/blog/index.html\", \"blog/index.html\"]`` under the hood."

"To achieve this, the middleware "
"``mezzanine.core.middleware.TemplateForDeviceMiddleware`` catches Django "
"``TemplateResponse`` responses, and changes the template list prior to the "
"response being rendered. As such, any views you implement should return "
"``TemplateResponse`` objects. The table below lists Mezzanine versions of "
"Django features that can be used to ensure a ``TemplateResponse`` is "
"returned."
