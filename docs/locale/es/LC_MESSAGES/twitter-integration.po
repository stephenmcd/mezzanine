"As of June 2013, Twitter also requires that all API access is authenticated."
" For this you'll need to configure a Twitter application with OAuth "
"credentials for your site to access the Twitter API. These credentials are "
"configurable as Mezzanine settings. See the :doc:`configuration` section for"
" more information on these, as well as the `Twitter developer site "
"<https://dev.twitter.com/>`_ for info on creating an application and "
"configuring your OAuth credentials."

"When setting up a Twitter application, you'll also be able to configure the "
"permissions your OAuth credentials have against the Twitter API. To consume "
"Twitter feeds, only read permissions are needed, but you may also choose to "
"allow both read and write permissions. With write permissions enabled, "
"you'll then also be able to expose the option in Mezzanine's admin interface"
" for automatically tweeting new blog posts (or your own custom content) when"
" they're published."
