    """
    Adds a page to the template context for the current response.

    If no page matches the URL, and the view function is not the
    fall-back page view, we try and find the page with the deepest
    URL that matches within the current URL, as in this situation,
    the app's urlpattern is considered to sit "under" a given page,
    for example the blog page will be used when individual blog
    posts are viewed. We want the page for things like breadcrumb
    nav, and page processors, but most importantly so the page's
    ``login_required`` flag can be honoured.

    If a page is matched, and the fall-back page view is called,
    we add the page to the ``extra_context`` arg of the page view,
    which it can then use to choose which template to use.

    In either case, we add the page to the response's template
    context, so that the current page is always available.
