# MEZZANINE SETTINGS #
######################

# The following settings are already defined with default values in
# the ``defaults.py`` module within each of Mezzanine's apps, but are
# common enough to be put here, commented out, for conveniently
# overriding. Please consult the settings documentation for a full list
# of settings Mezzanine implements:
# http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/configuration.html#default-settings

# Controls the ordering and grouping of the admin menu.
#
# ADMIN_MENU_ORDER = (
#     ("Content", ("pages.Page", "blog.BlogPost",
#        "generic.ThreadedComment", (_("Media Library"), "fb_browse"),)),
#     ("Site", ("sites.Site", "redirects.Redirect", "conf.Setting")),
#     ("Users", ("auth.User", "auth.Group",)),
# )

# A three item sequence, each containing a sequence of template tags
# used to render the admin dashboard.
#
# DASHBOARD_TAGS = (
#     ("blog_tags.quick_blog", "mezzanine_tags.app_list"),
#     ("comment_tags.recent_comments",),
#     ("mezzanine_tags.recent_actions",),
# )

# A sequence of templates used by the ``page_menu`` template tag. Each
# item in the sequence is a three item sequence, containing a unique ID
# for the template, a label for the template, and the template path.
# These templates are then available for selection when editing which
# menus a page should appear in. Note that if a menu template is used
# that doesn't appear in this setting, all pages will appear in it.

# PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES = (
#     (1, _("Top navigation bar"), "pages/menus/dropdown.html"),
#     (2, _("Left-hand tree"), "pages/menus/tree.html"),
#     (3, _("Footer"), "pages/menus/footer.html"),
# )

# A sequence of fields that will be injected into Mezzanine's (or any
# library's) models. Each item in the sequence is a four item sequence.
# The first two items are the dotted path to the model and its field
# name to be added, and the dotted path to the field class to use for
# the field. The third and fourth items are a sequence of positional
# args and a dictionary of keyword args, to use when creating the
# field instance. When specifying the field class, the path
# ``django.models.db.`` can be omitted for regular Django model fields.
#
# EXTRA_MODEL_FIELDS = (
#     (
#         # Dotted path to field.
#         "mezzanine.blog.models.BlogPost.image",
#         # Dotted path to field class.
#         "somelib.fields.ImageField",
#         # Positional args for field class.
#         (_("Image"),),
#         # Keyword args for field class.
#         {"blank": True, "upload_to": "blog"},
#     ),
#     # Example of adding a field to *all* of Mezzanine's content types:
#     (
#         "mezzanine.pages.models.Page.another_field",
#         "IntegerField", # 'django.db.models.' is implied if path is omitted.
#         (_("Another name"),),
#         {"blank": True, "default": 1},
#     ),

# If True, the django-modeltranslation will be added to the
# INSTALLED_APPS setting.
