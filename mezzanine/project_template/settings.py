# MEZZANINE SETTINGS #
######################

# The following settings are already defined with default values in
# the ``defaults.py`` module within each of Mezzanine's apps, but are
# common enough to be put here, commented out, for convenient
# overriding. Please consult the settings documentation for a full list
# of settings Mezzanine implements:
# http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/configuration.html#default-settings

# Controls the ordering and grouping of the admin menu.

#     ("Content", ("pages.Page", "blog.BlogPost",
#        "generic.ThreadedComment", ("Media Library", "fb_browse"),)),

# used to render the admin dashboard.

#     ("comment_tags.recent_comments",),
#     ("mezzanine_tags.recent_actions",),
# )

# A sequence of templates used by the ``page_menu`` template tag. Each
# item in the sequence is a three item sequence, containing a unique ID
# for the template, a label for the template, and the template path.
# These templates are then available for selection when editing which
# menus a page should appear in. Note that if a menu template is used
# that doesn't appear in this setting, all pages will appear in it.

# PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES = (
#     (1, "Top navigation bar", "pages/menus/dropdown.html"),
#     (2, "Left-hand tree", "pages/menus/tree.html"),
#     (3, "Footer", "pages/menus/footer.html"),
# )

# A sequence of fields that will be injected into Mezzanine's (or any
# library's) models. Each item in the sequence is a four item sequence.
# The first two items are the dotted path to the model and its field
# name to be added, and the dotted path to the field class to use for
# the field. The third and fourth items are a sequence of positional
# args and a dictionary of keyword args, to use when creating the
# field instance. When specifying the field class, the path
# ``django.models.db.`` can be omitted for regular Django model fields.
#
# EXTRA_MODEL_FIELDS = (
#     (
#         # Dotted path to field.

#         # Keyword args for field class.
#         {"blank": True, "upload_to": "blog"},

#     # Example of adding a field to *all* of Mezzanine's content types:
#     (
#         "mezzanine.pages.models.Page.another_field",
#         "IntegerField", # 'django.db.models.' is implied if path is omitted.
#         ("Another name",),
