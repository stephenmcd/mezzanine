    (non abstract) model in the inheritance chain that inherits from the

    query data consistently across the correct concrete model.

    Consider the following::

        class Abstract(models.Model)

            class Meta:

    need to query the ``Page`` model to determine correct values for ``slug``
    and ``_order`` which are only relevant in the context of the ``Page``
    model and not the model of the custom content type.
