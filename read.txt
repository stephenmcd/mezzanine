before running the server

Delete your database (db.sqlite3 in my case) in your project directory
Remove everything from __pycache__ folder under your project subdirectory
For the application you are trying to fix, go to the folder and clear migrations and __pycache__ directories
When you are sure you have cleared all the above files, run:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
